# Search Agent thingy (SAT)

A high-performance local-first RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system built with Next.js, Ollama, and LangChain. The system uses PostgreSQL with pgvector for embeddings, Redis for caching, and SearXNG for meta-search retrieval. The frontend is built with Next.js App Router, shadcn/ui, and Tailwind CSS, while the backend uses Drizzle ORM for database interactions and Server Actions for data operations.
